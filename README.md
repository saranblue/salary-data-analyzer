## ðŸ‘‹ About

Hi, I'm **Saran**, and this is one of my learning projects to practice Python and NumPy.  
This project helped me get familiar with:

- Generating random data with NumPy
- Creating command-line tools using `argparse` *(my first time!)*
- Exporting structured data to `.csv` files
- Writing clean, formatted Python code using **Black**

It's part of my learning journey and also something Iâ€™m proud to showcase on my GitHub for recruiters and fellow developers.
